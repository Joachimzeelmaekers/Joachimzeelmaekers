# 👋 Hi, I’m Joachim

**Senior Software Engineer** focused on building reliable systems, raising engineering quality, and helping teams grow.  

- I love writing about software engineering & growth at [joachimz.me](https://joachimz.me)
- Currently working at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) as a Senior Software Engineer
- Also contracting as a side business for start-ups. More info can be found [here](https://www.webtric.be) 

## What I Do

I care deeply about *how* software is built, not just *that* it works.

- Design and build scalable, maintainable systems
- Work across the stack with a strong product mindset
- Lead by example through _clean_ (or as clean as it can be) code, reviews, and mentoring
- Help teams make better technical decisions over time
- Continuously improve developer experience and delivery quality

## Engineering Focus

- **Architecture & system design** — thinking beyond the happy path
- **Code quality & maintainability** — readability, testing, and long-term health
- **Technical leadership** — influencing without authority
- **Developer growth** — mentoring, feedback, and shared standards

## Writing & Thought Leadership

I write to clarify my thinking and share lessons learned along the way.

Writing is a core part of how I am trying to give back to the community.
